                            <p>
                            Last years team started this project. Their core tasks included UX/UI, data collection, 
                            database design, application development, computer tracking, and voice interface. The 
                            students were divided up into teams to work on each task. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            They accomplished a lot but ran into some problems on the way. One of these included 
                            changing their entire database structure creating compatibility complications amongst
                            all the teams. The course's core curriculum is focused on database design, and this 
                            project truly reinforces that. This is a visual diagram of their database.

                            <h3>Professor Doore's Summer Research</h3>
                            <p>
                            Last summer, Anais Sarrazin(Class of 2020) conducted research with Professor Doore,
                            continuing the work that was accomplished in the Spring of 2019. Together, they 
                            published this paper.

                             They also travelled to Regensburg, Germany to present their research at the 14th
                            International Conference on Spatial Information Theory.

                            <h3>This Year's Progress</h3>
                            <p>This semseter, similair to last year, our class was divided into smaller groups to
                            work on different tasks. There was an additional team in charge of this website. 
                            COVID-19 created lots of complications, forcing many of the teams to completely reevaluate 
                            their goals. The teams learned the importance of communication because each team required 
                            information and compatibility from the others. Remote teamwork involved weekly meetings for
                            each team and a class wide meeting where each team would share the developments that they
                            made over the week. Each team also had a Microsoft team where they could view one anotherâ€™s
                            completed, ongoing, and future tasks on scrum boards. Here is an example from our Tracking Team:

                            </p>

                            <h4> Website Team </h4>
                            <p>

                            </p>
                        </TimelineItem>


                    </Timeline> 
                    </div>
                </div>
        </div>
    );
